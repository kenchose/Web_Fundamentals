            <h2>Let's Start From the Beginning</h2>
            <p>Rock climbing has became one of the worlds fastest growing sport for the past dedade. It has grown from a hobby
            to now a sport that is now iplementeed into the competition of sports in the olympics. I've started rock climbing when 
            I was at the age of 27 and have been climbing for about 5 years. Within the 5 years, I've grown to be a better climber 
            and advocate of cleaning the enviornment.</p>

            <h2>Moving On Up</h2>
            <p>There's more to climbing outdoors than being in better shape, living a healthy lifestyle, and having fun.
            There's many places outside of the area you are currently living. Obviously, if you go to an indoor gym than
            outside is not a possibility. But don't let that keep you away from trying it. Many clinbers are friendly and 
            are never shy to ask people to come out with them and climb. You know what they say, the more the marrier. Here 
            are some good places to go climbing around your area!</p>
